Initially studying Business, I would later focus on my efforts on Accounting and becoming a CPA. Unfortunately, when I finally got an Accounting internship, I quickly realised that it wasn’t the life I wanted. After taking a short break, I made a decision to pursue a career as a Softare Engineer. In doing so, I began to learn how to code on my own and eventually found myself in LA for a coding bootcamp at Hack Reactor. Unfortunately when COVID hit, I was unable to find work and was forced to make the hard decision of moving back home. To make the most of my time, I worked part time jobs, went back to school for my Bachelors in Computer Science, and eventually found work in IT. Committed to learning, I will always be grateful for the wealth of knowledge that came with the job as well as the opportunities that are to come. </p></div></div></div></div>',1),s=[i];function d(r,l){return t(),a("div",c,s)}const h=e(n,[["render",d],["__scopeId","data-v-7aec3f8f"]]);export{h as default};
